1.4.0
https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs
From the docs (but slightly modified so the paths make sense, since I'm not using unpkg.com stuff):
    <!-- Add this to <head> -->
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-relevant-folder]/bootstrap.min.css"/>
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="[path-to-relevant-folder]/bootstrap-vue.css"/>

    <!-- Add this after vue.js -->
    <script src="[path-to-relevant-folder]/polyfill.min.js"></script>
    <script src="[path-to-relevant-folder]/bootstrap-vue.js"></script>

Bootstrap-Vue DOES NOT use Bootstrap's javascript files.

(you can also go here https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-vue@1.4.0/dist/, or changing the url to the relevant version,
to get the files, including map files and such)

Since they're fairly active, there's probably newer versions since I wrote this, so consider upgrading.
