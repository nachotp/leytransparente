Currently: v2.5.13

Got the files from here:
https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Direct-lt-script-gt-Include

And also, to quote what it says there: Remember to use vue.js for development (for warning and such)
but change to vue.min.js for production.

(Btw, if you haven't already, get Vue devtools. It's a really useful browser extension)
