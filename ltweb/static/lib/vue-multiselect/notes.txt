Got the files from here:
https://unpkg.com/vue-multiselect@2.0.3/dist/

These versions are slightly different from what I found on the GitHub's dist folder (which
were causing an unimportant bug without any real visible effect, but seeing "false undefined"
in the console all the time bugged me a lot... heh, "bugged me")

In the future, you can probably still go here https://github.com/monterail/vue-multiselect
for the most recent versions (the GitHub's fairly active and there's a good chance there's been
bug fixes or even new features since I wrote this). Otherwise: https://unpkg.com/vue-multiselect
will automatically take you to the min.js of the (I assume) most recent version
